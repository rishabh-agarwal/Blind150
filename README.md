## 📝 Problem-Solving Process

For each problem:
1. Read and understand the problem statement.
2. Identify the category and patterns involved.
3. Write and test the solution in a chosen programming language (Java preferred for now).
4. Document the approach used, edge cases, and time/space complexity analysis.

---

## 🚩 Goals
- Solve all 150 problems in **X months** (set a realistic timeline).
- Focus on mastering problem-solving techniques and common patterns.
- Track progress consistently and revisit hard problems.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Languages:** Java, Python (occasionally for variety).
- **Tools:** IntelliJ IDEA, Jupyter Notebooks, Leetcode IDE.
